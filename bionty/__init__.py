"""Registries for basic biological entities, coupled to public ontologies.

Features
========

- Create records from entries in public ontologies using `.from_public()`.
- Access full underlying public ontologies via `.public()` to search & bulk-create records.
- Create in-house ontologies by using hierarchical relationships among records (`.parents`).
- Use `.synonyms` and `.abbr` to manage synonyms.

All registries inherit from :class:`~lamindb.dev.CanValidate` &
:class:`~lamindb.dev.HasParents` to curate, validate & annotate data, and from
:class:`~lamindb.dev.Registry` for query & search.

.. dropdown:: How to ensure reproducibility across different versions of public ontologies?

   It's important to track versions of external data dependencies.

   `bionty` manages it under the hood:

   - Versions of public databases are auto-tracked in :class:`PublicSource`.
   - Records are indexed by universal ids, created by hashing `name` & `ontology_id` for portability across databases.

.. note::

   Read the guides:

   - :doc:`/bio-registries`
   - :doc:`/validate`

   For more background on how public ontologies are accessed, see the utility
   library `Bionty-base <https://lamin.ai/docs/bionty-base>`__.
