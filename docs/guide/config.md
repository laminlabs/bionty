# Configuration

## Public bionty sources

Bionty maintains a [sources.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laminlabs/bionty/main/bionty/base/sources.yaml) listing public sources of each entity.
These sources are curated ([biony-assets](https://github.com/laminlabs/bionty-assets)) and stored in a [bionty-assets instance](https://lamin.ai/laminlabs/bionty-assets/) to provide fast and reliable access.
Cached sources files are stored at your local `bionty/base/_dynamic/` directory.

## Local bionty sources

File `$home:/.lamin/bionty/versions/sources_local.yaml` stores all locally available ontologies.
The content of this file is identical to the public `sources.yaml` for a freshly-installed Bionty.

**Users may edit this file in order to configure customized sources.**

## Display sources

The available and currently active ontologies can also be printed with
`bionty.base.display_available_sources` or `bionty.base.display_currently_used_sources`.

## Format of the sources yaml file

```yaml
entity: # Bionty entity class name, e.g. CellType
  source: # short name of the source, (CURIE prefix for ontologies) e.g. cl
    organism: # organism common name, (if none applied, use 'all') e.g. human
      version: # version of the source
        url: # "link to the source file"
```

## Setting default ontologies and versions

For each entity, the **first source** and its **maximum version** defined in `sources_local.yaml` is used as default.
To set your own default ontology and version, shift the order of entries.
For example, in the following "doid" used when "organism" is specified as "human":

(highlighted sources are considered the default)

We may change the default to "inhouse_diseases" when "organism" is specified as "human", by the following:
